Project Description:

This project implements a simplified Wordle-style game using a TCP client–server architecture.
The server loads a word bank and provides a random 5-letter word to each connected client.
The client allows the user to guess the word and uses feedback symbols:

+ correct letter, correct position
? correct letter, wrong position
_ letter not in word

Use simple ANSI color codes for nicer terminal output.

Communication between client and server is done using a simple text-based protocol.


Compile server:
g++ server.cpp library.cpp -o server

Run server:
./server        (default port 5000)
./server 6000   (custom port)

Compile client:
g++ client.cpp library.cpp -o client

Run client:
./client localhost
./client localhost 5000


Type Of Library Used:

The Library we used was a simple static code library (library.cpp / library.h) that is compiled into both 
the client and the server. It holds all the shared functionality, such as trimming input, validating guesses, 
loading the word list, comparing guesses, and sending/receiving newline-terminated messages over the network.



Protocol Description:

Client -> Server:
READY = Client ready for new word
WORD = Client requests word again
BYE/QUIT = Client disconnecting

Server -> Client:
HELLO = Greeting after connection
<5-letter-word> = Random Word from the bank 

The messages are terminated by a \n and the library's send_message() appends \n.
recieve_message() reads it until it find the null terminator \n
because of this procedure, both the client and server can detect message boundaries reliably.
 The server is implemented using C++ threads for concurrency, meaning each client is handled in its own detached thread.



Issues/Limitations:

Sometimes the first random word can repeat (for example, the server might always start with “drink”).
This happens when the server is restarted too quickly — all within the same second. 
Since srand(time(NULL)) only updates once per second, the random number generator ends up starting in the same place. 
After the server has been running for more than a second, the random word selection behaves normally and you’ll get different results.

If words.txt is missing, empty, or doesn’t contain any valid 5-letter words, the server will not start.
